<h1>Does access to health care accurately reflect poverty rates around the Detroit Metropolitan area?</h1>
<h3>Recently,  both my urban geography and environmental justice classes have been discussing the effect of urban poverty on people's access to basic human needs.  I chose to use my knowledge of QGIS to track the accessibility to health care centers in the Detroit area,  which is ranked second in the country for the city with the highest poverty rates.  Detroit itself is extremely racially segregated,  and certain neighborhoods lack basic infrastructure that prevents their residents from accessing medical care,  healthy food, and safety needs.  I started my map by creating a choropleth using poverty rates in Detroit and its surrounding neighborhoods,  with the darker green being the areas with higher poverty percentages.  I then layered points of government-recognized health care centers on top of the finished choropleth,  and created buffers with mile radii.  Considering that many inner-city residents may not have the physical capability of transportation,  I thought that a mile would be an appropriate distance expected between healthcare centers.  I discovered that many of the regions in Wayne county,  specifically those with extremely high poverty rates,  were not located near any type of health care center.  River Rouge and Ecorse,  specifically,  didn't have medical assistance for several miles.  I also noticed that Detroit itself had certain regions that were clustered with health care,  and others that seemed to be completely desolate of it.  Many of the regions with lower poverty rates,  such as Livonia and Grosse Pointe,  had a high density of medical care centers.  </h3>
