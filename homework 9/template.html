<h1>Homework 9: Map of Your Choice </h1>
<h2>Tyler Pereira</h2>
<h3>I chose to use a choropleth to display the variance in C02 emissions between states in the US in 2017.  I chose this data because I am an environmental studies major,  and I am in several other classes this semester that have studied greenhouse gas emissions and how location can affect them.  I thought that it would be fun to combine my knowledge from all of my classes.  I originally used an Equal Counts categorization so that each of the ranges in my legend would be clear and easy to understand,  but I also provided an option with the Equal Interval organization.  As you can see in the Equal Interval type,  Texas has an insane amount of C02 emissions compared to other states.  When viewing the data with equal counts,  Texas is a hidden outlier and appears to be the same color as many other states.  In reality,  Texas had more than 700 million metric tons of C02 emissions in 2017,  which is nearly twice the amount of the second-highest state,  California.  I utilized the equal interval map to show just how much higher the emissions are for Texas versus the rest of the US.  My units were in millions of metric tons,  and this data only applied to C02 emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels.  </h3>
