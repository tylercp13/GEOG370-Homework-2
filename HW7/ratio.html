<h1>Homework 8: Census Data Ratios and Categories </h1>
<h2>Tyler Pereira</h2>
<h3>Each of these maps compares the mean salary per county with the average salary across the state of Florida.  It only includes data from citizens above the age of sixteen.  Across the board,  there appears to be a good amount of variation in salaries,  but the Standard Deviation and Equal Count category times seem to be more effective for the analysis of this data, as they both clearly show the distinctions between Florida counties.</h3>

    <h3>This map utilized the standard deviation feature on QGIS to categorize the counties based on how much they deviated from the mean salary.  The overall appearance of this map looked similar to the one for Equal Counts,  but with a few changes in shades of green for certain counties.  This category type was particularly helpful for me, since I was comparing my original data to an average.  If I wasn't using averages at all,  I wouldn't expect this category to be too helpful in my analysis.  Overall,  it provided a well spread-out and accurate representation of salary inconsistencies by county.   </h3>

    <h3>This map included categories decided by Equal Counts.  This means that the categories were spaced out so that each range holds an equal amount of the data.  This model is useful because it means that all of the data will be evenly represented on the map itself,  and that the categories will be easily distinguishable.  For normal use,  this category would definitely be the best to use because it is both accurate and easy to visualize.  It can, however be erroneous in its placement of outliers,  and can group them in with other data that may not be similar to them.  </h3>

    <h3>This map used the Pretty Breaks category type.  While the legend for this kind of grouping is a little bit more aesthetically pleasing and simple than some of the others,  it doesn't necessarily create an accurate map.  For example,  the map above seems extremely biased to the lower sides of the ranges,  giving the entirety of the map an underwhelming, monochromatic appearance.  This isn't a very good trait to have when we are trying to analyze a choropleth based solely on its color gradients.  </h3>
