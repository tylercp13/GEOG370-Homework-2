<h1>Homework 7: Census Data Choropleth </h1>
<h2>Tyler Pereira</h2>
<h3>I chose to look at the average income of people above the age of sixteen in the state of Florida.  While I have no personal connections to this state,  I was interested in the financial differences by county.  I originally expected less of a dramatic change,  but was surprised by the major differences between regions in the state.  </h3>
